Copy both the "start.bat" & "script.ps1" scripts into the folder which you want to search for files with too long path names.
NOT RECOMMENDED: Placing the scripts directly in the C: drive will scan the whole system, which may take a very long time to complete.

Run the start.bat to start the search.
